<h1>Noise Reduction from an Acoustic Signature of a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This study proposes a novel denoising technique using digital signal processing to enhance total hip arthroplasty (THA) acoustic recordings. The method was tested on audio recordings acquired from 31 patients undergoing THA and was able to separate hammer-on-broach hits from the background noise of the operating room. The proposed technique can help emphasize the sounds of hammer-on-broach hits, which can aid experienced surgeons in selecting the optimal endpoint for implant and broach insertions. The approach also contributes to transitioning from subjective-based to automated, frequency-based, endpoint selection, which has the potential to be more accurate and reliable. This work demonstrates promising results for THA acoustic signal filtration, and has the potential to improve primary implant fixation.

Please note that the audio recordings used in this study are classified due to their nature as real patient data and cannot be shared publicly
